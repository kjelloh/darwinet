# Cached subversion history 2009-05-16 to 2014-12-02

The darwinet project was originally version controlled on sourceforge.

* [darwinet on sourceforge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/darwinet/)

I (kjelloh) cloned and added it to this repo using 'git-svn clone...' and 'git subtree add ...' as documented in [thinking.md](../docs/thinking/thinking.md).

The soruceforge project had two svn repos 'code' and 'common'. They are now in subfolders 'code' and 'common' here.

* For soruceforge committ history see [log.txt](log.txt).
