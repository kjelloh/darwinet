1) Security.


Currently the Darwinet Client passes the user's password to the Darwinet Server in an unsecured way. Future implementations need to use secure shared memory or a similar mechanism to ensure the password stays secure.


2) Synchronisation and messaging.

Stale lockfiles will be a problem. The Darwinet Client can detect that a server is not running because it cannot connect to the port described in the "server" file, but when spawning a new server, the stale lock file will make the function believe that a server is already running and it will incorrectly return success.

DarwinetServer::Spawn() blocks the application process on reading from a pipe. if the spawned process fails to write to the pipe, the process will block indefinitely. Need a timeout.
