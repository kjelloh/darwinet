# thinking out loud

## How can I get a better grip on this 'tha' thingy idea to make things 'happen'?

So how can I make darwinet real? When I am even unsure about the name?

* Is this 'darwinet' a good name (I invented it back in 2009)?
* Is [eidotha](https://github.com/kjelloh/eidotha) a better name to develop the core model?
* Is [pyrotha](https://github.com/kjelloh/pyrotha) a better name to name the core model?

And where does [cpptha](https://github.com/kjelloh/cpptha) fit into this whole 'tha thingy' thinking?

At least the 'darwinet' name eludes to the evolutionary character of a network. And the core idea is to build a digital realm where humans can share digital states. Where the state is an instance of a model of something. So although abstract this is thge core of things.

So 'pyrotha' is the perspective of 'tha on fire' that we can imagine to be about the 'fire' as the spirit to spread the services possible based on this tha-idea.

And 'eidotha' is the perspective of the platonic or archetyal abstract idea behind this 'tha thingy'. I suppose it could be seen as the ideal behind tha. But then what is in the edotha perspective that can serve as an abstract base of the more implementational pyrotha, cpptha and this darwinet?

Maybe the best way forward is more doocracy as in exploring what is possible by trying to make it happen. So still abstract. But I am thinking out loud here to get out of my thinking and dreaming bubble.

What would be cool is to make a small computer program that can act as a seed that incites humans to come together and make this 'tha thingy' digital life grow.

So what does this seed need to contain?

* It should enable sharing of states.
* We need a core model to instantiate as the state to share.
* I think I have a sound starting point for the model as the 'four tier tha model'.
* We need at least one way to share the state (a P2P protocol to distribute mutated state)
